DungeonGame is a short Zelda-inspired game where you can attack using the space bar and shoot by clicking.  You can die and win the game by defeating the
mini-boss. After defeating the mini-boss, you can go through the door to win. There are coins to collect and potions to heal yourself. If an enemy touches 
you, you lose health and can die if your health reaches 0.

In SpaceShooter, you move your ship by moving your mouse side to side and up and down to avoid being shot. You attack enemy ships by clicking. 
If you touch other ships, you will die when your health reaches 0. Your goal is to survive for as long as possible by collecting points.
